# N-Tap FIR Filter in System Verilog
Welcome to the N-Tab FIR Filter repository! This project contains a fully functional N-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter designed using System Verilog. The filter is aimed at digital signal processing applications where precision and efficiency are paramount.

**Factors Affecting Maximum Sample Rate**

● Number of Taps (N): More taps mean more computations per input sample,
directly impacting the time required to produce an output. This can limit the
maximum sample rate.

● Coefficient Width (COEFF_WIDTH): Larger coefficient widths increase the precision
of the filter but require more resources for multiplication, affecting computation
time.

● Data Width (DATA_WIDTH): Similar to coefficient width, larger data widths increase
precision but also increase the computational load.

● Accumulator Width (ACC_WIDTH): Ensures precision in summing the product of
coefficients and input samples but also impacts the size and speed of the adder
logic used.

● Clock Speed (clk): The frequency of the clock signal directly influences the
maximum sample rate. Higher frequencies allow faster processing but may
introduce issues like timing violations or increased power consumption.

**Improvements to Increase Sample Rate**

● Optimize Hardware Utilization: For FPGA implementations, ensuring that the
hardware resources (e.g., DSP blocks) are optimally used can enhance
performance. This might involve adjusting the bit widths to match the hardware
capabilities closely.

● Increase Parallel Processing: Implementing parts of the filter (such as tap
computations) in parallel can significantly improve throughput. This requires
more hardware resources but can reduce the total computation time per sample.

● Pipelining: Introducing pipelining stages in the computation can allow
subsequent operations to begin before the current operation is finished,
effectively increasing the clock rate at which the system can operate. This adds
latency but can substantially increase throughput.

● Algorithmic Optimizations: Employing algorithmic optimizations like the Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) for convolution (where applicable) can reduce the
computational complexity, especially for filters with a large number of taps.

● Adapt Filter Design: Reducing the number of taps or using approximations for
filter coefficients can simplify computations. This, however, might compromise
the filter's frequency response precision.

**Trade-offs**

● Resource Utilization vs. Performance: Implementing parallel processing and
pipelining requires more hardware resources. This increases the FPGA or ASIC
size, power consumption, and potentially the cost.

● Precision vs. Speed: Reducing the precision of data paths (data and coefficient
widths) can speed up computations but might degrade the filter's performance
due to lower resolution and increased quantization noise.

● Latency vs. Throughput: Pipelining improves throughput at the expense of
increased latency, which may be critical for real-time applications where
immediate response is required.

● Simplicity vs. Efficacy: Simplifying the filter by reducing taps or approximating
coefficients can impair the filter's ability to accurately eliminate unwanted signal
components or to precisely shape the signal's spectrum.

These improvements and trade-offs should be carefully considered based on the
specific application requirements, including the necessary sample rate, filter
characteristics (like the cutoff frequency and the stopband attenuation), and constraints
on hardware resources and power consumption.

**Filter Configuration**

● Number of Taps (N): 4

● Coefficients (COEFFS): [1, 2, 3, 4]

● Bit-widths: For simplicity, assume DATA_WIDTH, COEFF_WIDTH, and ACC_WIDTH are
sufficiently large to avoid overflow.

Input Sequence

Consider a simple input sequence of four samples: [4, 3, 2, 1].

Operation Steps

Initialization: When reset is asserted, the shift register and accumulator are
cleared. Let's start after the filter has been reset and begins processing the input
sequence.

First Input - 12:

● Before input: shift register = [0, 0, 0, 0]

● Input: 12

● Shift register after input: [12, 0, 0, 0]

● Output calculation:

● 12∗4+0∗3+0∗2+0∗1=48

● Output: 48

Second Input - -8:

● Before input: shift register = [12, 0, 0, 0]

● Input: -8

● Shift register after input: [-8, 12, 0, 0]

● Output calculation:

● -8∗4+12∗3+0∗2+0∗1=4

● Output: 4

Third Input - 7:

● Before input: shift register = [-8, 12, 0, 0]

● Input: 7

● Shift register after input: [7, -8, 12, 0]

● Output calculation:

● 7∗4+-8∗3+12∗2+0∗1=28

● Output: 28

Fourth Input - 15:

● Before input: shift register = [7, -8, 12, 0]

● Input: 4

● Shift register after input: [15, 7, -8, 12]

● Output calculation:

● 15∗4+7∗3+-8∗2+12∗1=77

● Output: 77

In the example behavior, the FIR filter with coefficients [4, 3, 2, 1] applies different
weights to the current and previous three samples. This specific set of weights
determines how the filter will modify the signal. For instance:

● The weights could represent a simple low-pass filter, which averages adjacent
samples (with specific emphasis given to recent samples due to the increasing
weights) to smooth out rapid changes in the signal, effectively reducing
high-frequency components.

● By changing the coefficients, the filter could be turned into a high-pass filter,
emphasizing changes and thus allowing high-frequency components to pass
while attenuating lower frequencies.

**Practical Interpretation**

● Noise Reduction: If the input signal contains high-frequency noise superimposed
on a lower-frequency useful signal, an appropriately designed FIR filter can
reduce the noise, making the useful signal more prominent.

● Signal Shaping: In communication systems, FIR filters are used to shape signal
pulses to optimize transmission characteristics and minimize interference.
